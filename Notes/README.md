## Statistical Thinking for Industrial Problem Solving. [Course by SAS - Free](https://vle.sas.com/course/view.php?id=1526)

"All processes can produce information that enables imporvement."

* [Stitch Fix](https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/)
* Fundamental principles:
	* All work occurs in a system of interconnected processes.
	* Variation exsist in all processes.
	* Understanding and reducing variation are keys to success.
* Making decisions with data:
	* Quantify and interpret the variation, both good and bad, you observe.
	* determine which methods to use and when.
* Problem : A failure to meet desired level of performance. OR a problem is a gap between exsisting/real and desired state. Many companies use term opportunity instead of problem for more optimistic perspective of it.
* DMAIC (Six Sigma) - Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.
* PDSA/PDCA - Plan, Do, Study/Check, ACT
* Statistical problem solving -> Problem - Cause - Solution - Sustain.
* A problem statement is important - It should provide context, severity, and importance. Should answer - what, when, where, and how much (or how many).
* A problem goal statement - Includes, KPI(provides direct measure of problem team is trying to solve - Ex: Yield, Cycle time, Elapsed time, Proportion of scrapped, Proportion of out of specs, Proportion of finished goods returned),the current state, the desired state, and the timeframe. 
* High level process map(SIPOC Map) -> Input-Transformation(process or system)-Output. SIPOC: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customers.
* A process details should not be less should not be more - especially at the start of project, a high level understaning of the project is what is expected.
* To understand the process:
	* Observe the process.
	* Interview the prople involved in the process.
	* Interview internal suppliers and external customers.
	* Review operating procedures and manuals. 
	



## Terms/Defs:

* SIPOC: Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, and Customers/CTQs.
* CTQs : Critical to Quality measures. (Customer requriements)
* DMAIC (Six Sigma) : Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control.
* PDSA/PDCA : Plan, Do, Study/Check, Act.
